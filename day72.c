/* Problem Statement
Given a string s consisting of lowercase letters, find the first repeated character in the string. A character is considered repeated if it appears more than once, and among all such characters, the one whose second occurrence has the smallest index should be returned.

Input Format

Output Format
Print the first repeated character. If no character is repeated, print -1.
